The dataset collected from the open source is initially divided into train and test dataset. The ensemble model is provided with training dataset for generating the crop suggestion prediction model. The test data is given to the model, once the model is generated with minimum error and maximum accuracy. The inputs are fed to the generated model. The model then predicts and suggests the crops to be sown with an accuracy of about 99.31%.
